# stay_hydrated_bot

A Discord bot that gives reminders on how often and how much water you should be drinking.

h!help - brings up the list of commands the bot can take

h!hydrate - opts into the reminders

h!dehydrate - opts out of the reminders

h!interval [number] - customise how often you receive the reminders

h!dm - toggles whether you receive reminders via the server's "hydration_room" or via direct message.

TODO list: shorter reminders, make the reminders persistent whenever the glitch.com unexpectedly resets the bot
